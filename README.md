# Flashcard-o-matic

Create the front-end for a flashcard application

> "A local school has decided to put together a flash card application, Flashcard-o-matic, to help their students study online. Teachers will use this application to create decks of flash cards for the subjects that they teach, and students will study the decks. The school needs you to build the application that the students and teachers will use."

This project was designed to test my ability to work with rending and state management while using React. To succeed at this project, I needed to demonstrate that I could do the following:

- Installing packages via NPM
- Running tests from the command line
- Writing React function components
- Creating routes, including nested routes, using React Router
- Using hooks like useState(), useParams(), and useHistory()
- Debugging React code through console output and using the VS Code debugger

## Instructions 
To launch the app, please clone this repository and open up to it's directory.

In the command line, run:
~~~
